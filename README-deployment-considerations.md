# Deployment

> A place to write down costs and considerations when it comes to deploying this application. The goal is to figure out how to do this as cheap as possible even with a e-commerce aspect to the site

## application

- Vercel (free tier until e commerce is implemented)
- consider e-commerce elsewhere(shopify?) and route to a subdomain

## database

- Supabase

## media

- Currently using Cloudinary but the cost is too high
- Backblaze vs s3
